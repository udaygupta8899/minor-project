## **Project Title:**

**Advanced Recommender System Using Graph Neural Networks**

---

## **Project Idea:**

Design and implement a state-of-the-art recommender system that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model complex relationships between users and items. The system aims to provide highly accurate and personalized recommendations by capturing higher-order connectivity patterns in user-item interaction graphs. This project will explore novel GNN architectures and techniques specifically tailored for recommender systems, contributing to advancements in the field.

## **Problem Statement:**

Traditional recommender systems often struggle with capturing the intricate and dynamic relationships between users and items, especially as data grows in scale and complexity. Collaborative filtering methods may fail to consider indirect relationships and higher-order connectivity, leading to suboptimal recommendations. Moreover, issues like data sparsity, cold-start problems, and scalability hinder the performance of existing systems.

Graph Neural Networks offer a promising solution by modeling user-item interactions as graphs, where nodes represent users and items, and edges represent interactions. By leveraging GNNs, it is possible to capture both direct and indirect relationships in the data, leading to improved recommendation accuracy. However, the application of GNNs in recommender systems is still an emerging area, with challenges in scalability and effective integration of side information.
